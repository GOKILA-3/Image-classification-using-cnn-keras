# Image-classification-using-cnn-keras

**Overview**

This project is a deep learning-based animal classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras. The model is trained to classify images of different animal species.

**Features**

Deep Learning Model: Uses CNN for image classification.
Keras with TensorFlow Backend: Implements a CNN architecture using Keras.
Dataset Handling: Trained on a dataset of various animal images.
Real-Time Prediction: Can be integrated with a camera for real-time animal classification.

**Installation**

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib

**You can install dependencies using:**

pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib

**Model Architecture**

**The CNN model consists of:**

Convolutional layers for feature extraction
MaxPooling layers for down-sampling
Fully connected layers for classification
Softmax activation for multi-class classification

**Dataset**

Ensure you have a dataset of various animal images.

**Results**

The model achieves good accuracy in classifying different animal species.
Can be fine-tuned with a larger dataset for better performance.
